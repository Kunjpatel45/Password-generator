# Password-generator

Project Description:
This Python script is designed to generate a random password and append it along with the user's name to an Excel file named "project.xlsx". The user is prompted to input their name and desired password length, and the script generates a password according to the specified length. It also validates user inputs to ensure the name consists only of alphabetical characters and that the password length is at least 8 characters long.

Dependencies:

Python 3.x
openpyxl
pyinputplus
Installation:

Install Python: If you don't have Python installed, you can download and install it from the official Python website.
Install openpyxl and pyinputplus: You can install these dependencies using pip by running the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:
Copy code
pip install openpyxl
pip install pyinputplus
Usage:

Download the Python script (password_generator.py) and ensure you have the dependencies installed.
Run the script by executing the command python password_generator.py in your terminal or command prompt.
Follow the prompts to input your name and desired password length.
Your randomly generated password will be displayed, and it will be appended along with your name to the Excel file "project.xlsx" in the same directory as the script.
Notes:

Ensure that you have permissions to read from and write to the Excel file.
The Excel file "project.xlsx" should exist in the same directory as the script. If it doesn't exist, the script will raise an error.
